# xgboost_classification
In this repo, I applied XGBoostClassifier to Transfusion Data for given blood type prediction accuracy.

While applying XGBoost, I set base learners as Decision Tree Classifier.

I measured accuracy by accuracy_score.

I also used RandomizedSearch C.V. to set the best hyperparameters for a given algorithm.
