# xgboost_classification

- In this repo, I applied XGBoostClassifier for a transfusion Data to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus. It is a binary classification task.
- While applying XGBoost, I set the base model as Logistic Regression. Afterwards, I've tuned the params with RandomizedSearch C.V.
- I have evaluated the model with accuracy.
